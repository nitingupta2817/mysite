    <p>A bustling city, suffocated by thick smog, stands as a testament to urban pollution, its towering skyscrapers barely visible through the haze while congested streets crawl with cars spewing toxic fumes. Beyond the city’s edge, a desolate landscape reveals the scars of deforestation—once-thriving forests reduced to barren soil and scattered stumps. Amidst the devastation, a single sad, lonely tree remains, its frail branches reaching toward the sky, a poignant symbol of resilience yet a stark reminder of environmental neglect. As bulldozers rumble in the distance and the horizon fades into dust and smoke, the tree endures, a silent witness to the destruction, desperately clinging to life in a world on the brink of irreversible change.</p>

    <p>The consequences of our actions are devastating. Glaciers are melting at alarming rates, causing habitats for animals like polar bears and penguins to disappear. Wildlife is rapidly vanishing, unable to adapt to the changing environment. In urban areas, people are forced to wear masks due to poor air quality, a direct result of pollution and environmental neglect. Climate change is an ever-present threat, endangering our planet's future and the survival of countless species. We must act now to prevent further harm.</p>

<h3>THREE WAYS TO SAVE THE TREES</h3>   

<div class=maintest>
    
    <div class=test2><h1>Plant More Trees</h1> <p>Encourage community tree-planting events and participate in reforestation projects. By planting more trees, we can replenish those that have been cut down and create new green spaces that benefit both the environment and our health.</p> <img src="/static/planting.jpg" class="you"></div> 
    <div class=test2><h1>Sustainable Practices</h1> <p>Choose products made from recycled materials and those certified by sustainable forestry programs. By supporting companies that prioritize environmental responsibility, we can reduce the demand for deforestation.</p> <img src="/static/recycle.jpg" class="you"></div>
    <div class=test2><h1>Policy Change</h1> <p>Engage in activism to support laws and regulations that protect forests and promote conservation. By advocating for stronger environmental policies, we can ensure long-term protection for our trees and natural habitats.</p> <img src="/static/law.jpg" class="you"></div>

    It is crucial for humanity to recognize the importance of preserving nature for the future of all life on Earth. The relentless harm we inflict on the environment—through deforestation, pollution, and over-exploitation of natural resources—endangers not only the planet but also our own survival. 
   <br> 
   <br>Ecosystems that provide clean air, water, and food are being destroyed at an alarming rate, threatening the balance that sustains all living organisms. By continuing this path of environmental degradation, we risk not only irreversible damage to the natural world but also the future well-being of generations to come. 
    Understanding our responsibility to protect and restore nature is essential if we hope to secure a livable, thriving planet for both human beings and the countless species that depend on it.
